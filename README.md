fpl_knowledge.append({
    "id": "my_strategy",
    "text": "Your strategic insight here...",
    "category": "strategy"
})
```

### New ML Models
Extend the predictor with custom models:

```python
# In FPLMLPredictor class
self.models['your_model'] = YourCustomModel()
```

### API Customization
Adapt for other fantasy leagues:

```python
# In FPLDataManager
